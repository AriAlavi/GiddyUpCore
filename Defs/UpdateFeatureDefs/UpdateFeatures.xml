		<content>A new mod for the Giddy-up! Series is released!
		
I am proud to present Giddy-up! Caravan. With this mod you can let your colonists ride to far lands on elephants, muffalos, lamas or any other animal, modded or not! 
Check it out on steam, or on the mod's page on the Ludeon forums.

		<content> I'm happy to announce a big update that applies to all Giddy-up! mods.
		
&lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt; Big changes in Giddy-up! Core: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;
- Enemy and friendly NPC mounts that have their rider thrown off will no longer become wild animals, but instead they will keep fighting until one of the following happens:
--> Their rider remounts the animal (riders will now attempt to remount their animal whenever possible).
--> The rider owning the animal is killed or downed. In this case the animal will flee in panic and leave the map, as there's no longer a master around to control it. 
Note: When facing a dangerous mount, it's now more important than ever to kill its rider, so that it starts fleeing.
- If an enemy mount is downed, it is now turned into a wild animal so you can still tame or hunt it. 

&lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt; Big changes in Giddy-up! Caravan:  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;
- Friendly NPCs will now park their mount when arriving at your colony, and hop on again when they leave.
- A new zone has been added, named: &lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt; NPC mount spot &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. When friendly NPCs arrive, they will park their mounts at the nearest NPC mount spot. Go check this out in Architect->Zone/Areas
Note: Place this spot in a room and you have your own stable for guests! 

&lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt; Small changes and fixes  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;
- The caravan dialog should no longer lag when using Giddy-up! Caravan. 
- Fixed GUI issue in caravan dialog that appeared when a mount died during a map event (like an ambush).
- The right click menu item for mounting now also displays the mounts name when using Giddy-up! Battle Mounts.
- Updated Spanish translations (by mora145)
		
Good luck playing!
