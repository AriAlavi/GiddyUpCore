All Giddy-up! mods except Giddy-up! Mechanoids have been updated to support Rimworld version 1.1 (including the expansion). Credits for this update go to Sarg Bjornson, who's responsible for a major part of this update. This version also supports Rimworld 1.0, so no need to worry if you're still using that version. 

Giddy-up! Mechanoids will be updated once What the Hack has been updates (which will take some time). 

This update includes the following improvements and fixes: 
- Added more overlays for vanilla animals. These overlays prevent that pawns overlap the heads, horns or other things that animals have. 
- Made sure the name tag of a pawn doesn't overlap the animal's head when an animal is mounted. 
- Fixed null reference errors that the wait for rider job sometimes threw.
- Compatibility with the new HugsLib version.
